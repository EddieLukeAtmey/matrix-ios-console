Build instructions
==================

Before opening the Console Xcode workspace, you need to build it with the
CocoaPods command::

        $ cd Console
        $ pod install

This will load all dependencies for the Console source code, including MatrixKit and MatrixSDK.

Then, open ``matrixConsole.xcworkspace`` with Xcode

        $ open matrixConsole.xcworkspace
